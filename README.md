-Our Profile Web Project is a modern and visually stunning web application built with React, Framer Motion, React Toastify, React Scroll, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a platform for users to create and showcase their professional profiles in a visually appealing and interactive way. The application uses smooth animations, responsive design, and intuitive navigation to offer a seamless user experience.
